                <hr />
                <p class="main-body-text">I've always been into technology. I'm your regular enthusiast when it comes to
                  computers and
                  electronics of any kind. I
                  love watching, helping, and being there as technology grows. I have several computers and a few old
                  rack-serves that I
                  work on as a hobby. Along with hanging out with friends, most of my free time is spent tinkering and
                  trying out
                  different things. My more recent projects have been/are setting up a local data base and learning how
                  to run a website,
                  C#/Node.js server and data bae all on my local systems. I don't have the technology to properly setup
                  security, so I'll
                  probably just settle with running it locally for right now.</p>

                <hr />
                <p class="main-body-text">I was privileged enough to get a job right after I turned 16. I was able to
                  land the job at the Jack
                  in The Box between
                  my house and the high school I was in thanks to the help of a friend at the time. I grew to really
                  like the team I
                  worked with at the time. Though for a time, as it goes with fast food, the management was replaced
                  with someone who
                  wasn't as good as the last. During this time the management was bad enough for me to pick up a second
                  job at Dominos for
                  about 8 months. At the start of that 8 months I was still in school, so managing both was a little
                  difficult, but
                  eventually I was able to schedule one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. In the last half
                  of the 14 months I
                  worked at Jack in The Box I started taking on responsibilities of the team leads and even the GM when
                  it came to
                  inventory. It went downhill very quickly as the now new General Manager (GM) didn't see me for any of
                  that. And only as
                  the minor who was 50-60 hours a week. Which understandable was a liability for her. As it was
                  technically illegal for me
                  to be working that much. But even then, I had bills to pay. So, following my two weeks and
                  resignation, a received a job
                  offer at taco bell. I worked there for about 4 months before leaving there for a better opportunity at
                  Sevy Brothers
                  Construction. There I worked with literally all 5 of my roommates and ~6 other friends and family of
                  theirs, until I had
                  to leave there for health reasons nearly four months later. Which is when started into BoiseCodeCamp,
                  bringing me here
                  to you.</p>

                <h3 class="d-flex justify-content-center">Hobbies</h3>
                <hr />
                <p class="main-body-text">I personally have several hobbies if I were to be honest with myself, yet I
                  wouldn't consider having
                  any hobbies except
                  enthusiasm. I'm not necessarily devoted to much but I do a lot of hobby like things. the best way to
                  describe it would
                  be having 5 hobbies in a constant state of flux. Most of the time though, the most persistent is
                  defiantly my baby. my
                  computer. I lo9ve working on/with computers. the future both excites me and kind of puts me down. only
                  because I realize
                  I won't always be here to see technology continue to grow. I really love Sci-Fi games because they
                  show a very exciting
                  future with technology. and yes, I realize what you may be thinking. "Sci-Fi is just science
                  <i>fiction</i>." Yes, yet
                  also no. Even the most outlandish Sci-Fi is based on some science. and in fact, the Sci-Fi of
                  yesterday is just todays
                  science, even better most of the time. in my mind <em>technology has no limits</em>, and I want to bet
                  there to test it!</p>
